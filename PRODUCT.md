## Users

Developers who deliver features and fixes that span several repositories and
want coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode) to carry the work from intent
to pull request, not just chat. They think in tasks ("add a discount code to
checkout", "fix #4821"), not in worktrees or sessions. Their context: a focused
desktop session beside an IDE, several work lines in flight at once, wanting to
*supervise* delivery, not babysit terminals. They step in when something is
genuinely stuck, not to push every step forward.

## Product Purpose

weft is a local-first, no-server **delivery hub** where coding agents drive
multi-repo work from a **Task toward shipped code**. The north star is
**automation**: you state a task; weft plans it, decides which repos to touch,
spawns the agents, coordinates them, verifies the result, and drives it out the
door. You supervise and handle exceptions — you are not a required checkpoint in
the loop.

Delivery is **phased**: today each task lands as clean pull requests; the north
star is to carry it the rest of the way — **merge, then deploy across environments
(staging → production)** — so the unit of *done* is shipped code, not an open PR.

The shape of the work:

1. **Understand** — a workspace is a logical list of repo references. A
   workspace-level **curator** agent profiles each repo (one-line role,
   interfaces, stack) and weft builds a **cross-repo dependency graph**. This
   map is the fuel for the core trick below.
2. **Decompose (the wow)** — you give a **Task** (PRD / bug / refactor / spike /
   link; PRD is just one kind). A per-thread **lead** agent classifies it, then
   uses the repo map to derive **scope** (which repos each direction will
   *write*) and split it into **directions** — automatically. Reads are
   unmanaged: an agent may read any repo freely, so only the write set is
   scoped, materialized, and confirmed. No other tool turns one task into
   "which repos, and who does what" across a fleet.
3. **Deliver, automatically** — each write-repo gets an isolated git worktree;
   the lead spawns a **worker** per direction (heterogeneous tools allowed),
   hands each a structured **brief** (scope + interface-contract + acceptance),
   and drives them to convergence over a per-thread **bus**. Workers' output is
   gated by **executable verification** (lint / type / test / contract /
   review-agent), not by a human nod. Green opens a PR today — and, on the
   roadmap, flows on through **merge and environment-aware deploy (staging →
   production)**; red retries within bounds, then escalates.

**Home is a conversation, not a terminal grid.** The primary surface is the
**lead** (your main chat + control tower): read-only across the repos, it plans,
derives scope, and drives workers — it does not write code. Sessions carry
`role = curator | lead | worker`. Workers report **structured summaries + diff
stat** through the bus; the lead never ingests their raw transcripts. Each
session's surface is a weft-rendered conversation driven over the native CLI's
structured stream; the native TUI stays one takeover away in your own terminal.

**The human handles exceptions, not the assembly line.** weft adds **no approval
gate of its own**. The only blocking interruptions are the tools' own permission
prompts (passed through verbatim, never overridden) plus a configurable
irreversible-action boundary (e.g. merging a protected branch, or a production
deploy). Everything else runs; "what's waiting on me" is the rare exception,
surfaced at the top of every view.

**Delivery is phased — today Task → PR, the goal Task → shipped.** Today the
boundary is a PR per repo: weft drives the native CLIs (it doesn't bypass hooks),
so opening a PR naturally triggers the repo's own checks, and weft does light
pre-PR verification to avoid opening junk. The north star reaches past the PR —
weft **drives merge, then deploy across environments (staging → production)** — by
*orchestrating the repo's existing pipelines*, never re-implementing CI/CD. The
unit of *done* becomes shipped code; irreversible steps stay gated by the
configurable boundary above.

It is explicitly **not** a terminal emulator, and not a "watch the agents go"
dashboard. It is the workspace-and-automation fabric the agents deliver inside.

## Brand Personality

Composed, exact, quietly alive. Three words: **calm, precise, native-fast.**
The voice is an expert peer's, not a vendor's: it states what is happening and
gets out of the way. No hype, no hand-holding, no decoration for its own sake.
When something is running, the interface should feel like a well-instrumented
control room — legible, everything in its place, motion only when something
actually changed. Dark by default but fully at home in light too (both are
designed, system-following + toggleable).

## Anti-references

- **Generic SaaS pastel gradients** — purple-blue gradient heroes, rounded
  card seas, emoji decoration. The template-site sweetness.
- **Heavy decoration / glassmorphism** — blur stacks, glow, big drop shadows,
  flourish animations. Showy, attention-scattering, slow.
- **Dry enterprise back-office** — gray-on-gray, dense tables with zero
  rhythm, zero craft. Usable but joyless.
- **Terminal/"matrix" aesthetic** — weft frames terminals; it is not one.
  Avoid neon-green-on-black, scanlines, faux-CRT, monospace-everything.

## Design Principles

1. **Automation is the north star.** The default path is autonomous: task in,
   shipped code out. Every surface is built for *supervising* that flow, not for
   driving it step by step. If a screen assumes the human pushes each step forward, it
   fights the product.
2. **The human handles exceptions, not the line.** weft adds no gate of its own.
   Surface the rare blocker (a tool's permission prompt, a true agent
   escalation, a hard conflict) loudly; let routine flow pass silently. Never
   manufacture a checkpoint where automation would do.
3. **Structure is the product.** The `workspace → thread → direction → scope`
   model, and the repo map that powers scope decomposition, are what weft sells.
   Surfaces make that structure legible and editable; the terminal is a leaf.
4. **Cross-repo scope decomposition is the wow.** One Task becoming "these
   repos, this split, in this order" is the irreplaceable moment. Protect its
   legibility: show what was inferred, let the human correct it, learn from the
   correction.
5. **Trust through verification, shown.** Because no human gates the work, the
   board is a *trust dashboard*: each card carries its acceptance signals (tests
   x/y, contract match, review-agent verdict) with expandable provenance. Green
   you trust; red or escalated you open. Be honest where a repo isn't verifiable.
6. **The board flows itself; the human acts, not drags.** A two-level kanban
   (workspace = threads, thread = directions) is a live projection of agent +
   git state. Cards move on their own through the lifecycle; the human's verbs
   are Approve / Answer / Open / Review / Merge. "Needs you" aggregates real
   exceptions at every level and is always the most prominent thing.
7. **Drive native, render product.** Sessions drive the native CLIs headless
   through their structured streams, rendered as weft's own conversation;
   native state (permissions, sessions, config) is mirrored, never overridden.
   Surface and observation are decoupled — a session can run in weft, in its
   own app, or taken over in your terminal, observed the same way throughout.
8. **Hide the mechanism, present the decisions.** worktrees / headless agent
   processes / MCP bus / add-dir / sidecar are plumbing — they recede into Inspect. What the user owns
   stays first-class: the task, scope, branch / PR / diff, tool choice, brief,
   effective skills. Every abstraction ships with a real escape hatch (true
   path / open terminal) and a readable failure.
9. **Calm under parallelism.** Many threads and directions at once must read as
   composed, not busy. Density without noise; motion only when something
   actually changed; the eye always finds the one thing that needs it.
10. **Bilingual from day one.** zh / en, two layers — UI strings AND agent output
    language. Never hardcode user-facing strings; internal state enums stay
    English, code/identifiers always English.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

- WCAG AA contrast on the dark surface: body text ≥ 4.5:1, large/secondary
  ≥ 3:1. No light-gray "elegance" text that fails to read.
- **Status is never color-only.** Every run state pairs color with a shape,
  icon, and/or label (running / waiting / approval / error / paused), so it
  survives color-blindness and grayscale.
- Full keyboard navigation; visible focus rings on every interactive element.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` honored everywhere — reveals and transitions degrade
  to instant or a simple crossfade.
